#### Overview

Proximac is an command-line open-source alternative to Proxifier. With Proximac, it can force App to use SOCKS5 proxy. In the other words, it can forward any App's traffic to a certain SOCKS5 proxy. Moreover, Proximac now can forward all network traffic in your system to a proxy which means you may not need a VPN to do this job. I hope more developers can join this project.

###### :blush: Welcome to contribute code to this project! If you have any idea, feel free to contact me!

Features:

1. Support global traffic forwarding (VPN mode).
2. Support SOCKS5 authentication using username/password.

Note: Proximac only works on Mac OSX.

#### Usage
1. If you plan to use Proximac on OSX 10.10+, please run ```sudo nvram boot-args="debug=0x146 kext-dev-mode=1"```.  For 10.11, do Restart -> Press COMMAND + R -> Recovery Mode -> Terminal -> csrutil enable --without kext --without debug.

1. Install libuv first. Run ```brew install libuv``` or whatever works
2. Run ```curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/proximac-org/proximac-install/master/install.py |sudo python ```
3. Set up your config file which indicates Proximac's work mode (VPN or per-App) and proxy configuration
4. Run ```proximac start -c [path of your config file]``` to start Proximac
5. Run ```proximac stop``` to stop Proximac

#### How to build from source
NOTE: Proximac is based on libuv. So, before compile this project, make sure [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) was successfully installed:

	$ git clone https://github.com/libuv/libuv.git
	$ cd libuv
	$ sh autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make install

Then, open Xcode project file and build it.



#### An example of the config file
We use almost the same config file as shadowsocks do but add new arguments. (**Not in VPN mode**)

```
{
    "process_name":
    ["Unibox", "Google Chrome", "Thunder"],
    "local_port":1080,
    "local_address":"127.0.0.1",
    "proximac_port":8558,
    "username":"foo",
    "password":"bar"
}
```
Note:

***process_name*** are names of processes that you want to force to use SOCKS5 proxy, which can be found in ***Contents/MacOS*** folder inside those Apps (right click on Apps to get inside).

***local_address*** and ***local_port*** is the ip address and the listen port of your SOCKS5 proxy, respectively.

Leave ***proximac_port*** alone because this is now hardcoded in kext source. ***username*** and ***password*** are for SOCKS5 proxy required authentication if needed. If your SOCKS5 proxy does not require authentification, just remove these two lines.

There is another example (**VPN mode**)

```
{
    "local_port":1080,
    "local_address":"127.0.0.1",
    "proximac_port":8558,
    "VPN_mode":1,
    "proxyapp_name":"ShadowsocksX"
}
```
Set ***VPN_mode*** to 1 to enable VPN mode.
Set ***proxyapp_name*** to your proxy's process name in case network traffic are trapped in a loop or we can call it a white-list but now Proximac only supports one proxy.
